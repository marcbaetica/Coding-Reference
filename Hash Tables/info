- used for fast insertion and retrieval of data (almost in constant time)
- esentially a set of key-value pairs
- keys or values can be any sort of object
- keys can be anything but must be included in the value object


Direct Access Tables
(only when keys are integers, keys are distinct and can not be extremely large)
to solve this issue we use the technique of HASHING

Hashing
hash function maps keys "randomly" into slots (array indices) of table T (array)
