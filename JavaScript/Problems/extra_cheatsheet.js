//Sift through Text with REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
/*Regular expressions are used to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.
For example, if we wanted to find the word the in the string The dog chased the cat, we could use the following regular expression: /the/gi

the is the pattern we want to match.
g means that we want to search the entire string for this pattern instead of just the first match.
i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.

Regular expressions are written by surrounding the pattern with / symbols.*/

  var digit = /\d+/g;		//For finding numbers within a string this is often written as /\d+/g, where the + following the digit selector allows this regular expression to match multi-digit numbers.
  var whitespaces = /\s+/g;	//The whitespace characters are " " (space), \r (carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (form feed).
  var expression = /\S/g;	//You can invert any match by using the uppercase version of the selector \s versus \S for example.
